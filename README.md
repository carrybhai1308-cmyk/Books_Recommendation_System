# Books Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a Book Recommendation System that suggests books to users using popularity-based and item-to-item collaborative filtering methods.  
Built with Python and scikit-learn, it provides personalized recommendations based on user ratings and trends.

## Techniques Implemented
1. Popularity-Based Recommendation
   - Suggests the most popular books based on ratings or frequency.

2. Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similarity)
   - Finds relationships between books using cosine similarity.
   - Recommends similar books based on user-item interactions.

## What I Learned
- How recommendation systems work in practice.
- Differences between popularity-based and collaborative filtering.
- Using cosine similarity to find related items.
- Building recommendation pipelines with scikit-learn.

## Dataset
- Book details (title, author, publisher, year)
- User ratings
