# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project is a *Book Recommendation System* where I explored different approaches for recommending books to users.  
The system is built using *Python (scikit-learn)* and applies both *popularity-based* and *item-to-item collaborative filtering* methods.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Techniques Implemented
1. *Popularity-Based Recommendation*
   - Recommends books based on the most popular ones (highest ratings or most frequently rated).
   
2. *Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similarity)*
   - Used *scikit-learn cosine similarity* to find relationships between books.
   - Recommends similar books based on user-item interactions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What I Learned
- How *Recommendation Systems* are built in practice.  
- The difference between *popularity-based* and *similarity-based (collaborative)* approaches.  
- How *cosine similarity* works in finding related items.  
- Basics of using *scikit-learn* for building recommendation pipelines.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Challenges Faced
- Understanding how collaborative filtering works behind the scenes.  
- Figuring out how to clean and prepare data for recommendations.  
- Implementing cosine similarity correctly and interpreting the results.

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset
- Contains book information (title, author, publisher, year, etc.)  
- Includes user ratings data.

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git
   cd Book_Recommendation_System
